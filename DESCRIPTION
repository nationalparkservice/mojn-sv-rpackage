Description: This package provides a collection of straightforward functions for data quality control, analysis, and visualization. It was developed specifically for data collected as part of the NPS Mojave Desert Network's long-term Spring Vegetation monitoring protocol. Out of the box, this package will be of limited use for other monitoring protocols, but the source code may be a useful jumping-off point for anyone who is interested in implementing a similar package.
